# Attendee Code-of-Conduct
BSides Amsterdam is a conference by the information security community, for the information security community. Facilitating a pleasant atmosphere for all attendees is a core aim of the BSides Amsterdam organisers and as an attendee/participant you agree to be bound by the BSides Amsterdam Attendee Code-of-Conduct.

#### Purpose

The purpose of this Code-of-Conduct is:
- To ensure a constructive, inclusive and pleasant atmosphere for all volunteers and attendees of the BSides Amsterdam conference.
- To ensure that all participants know what behaviour they have a right to expect from other attendees, volunteers and organisers.
- To ensure that all participants know what behaviour is expected of them whilst attending the BSides Amsterdam conference.

#### Respect for Others

Attendees will:
- Treat the organisers and volunteers with respect and follow any instructions given. The BSides Amsterdam volunteers and organisers have given up a significant amount of time to facilitate this conference for the benefit of the attendees.
- Respect the presenters, do not talk among yourselves during their presentations, ensure your mobile phones are muted or switched off once you are attending a presentation, avoid leaving until the end of the presentation, as to minimize disruption to the other attendees and the presenter. Heckling and constant harassment of presenters will not be tolerated.
- Asking questions is what makes this a great community, but do respect the presenter’s method for handling questions (e.g. do not interrupt to comment or jump to ask a question if the presenter prefers questions at the end of the session) and do not monopolise the presenter/speaker (be concious of time and allow other attendees the opportunity to ask questions as well).
- Treat all that are present at the conference fairly and equally.
- Do not discriminate against any person.
- Allow others to express themselves and understand that all views are important even if they are not the same as your own - as long as no offence is caused even if that is unintentionl.
