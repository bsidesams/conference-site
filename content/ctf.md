**Registration:** 

If you are attending the conference as well, please make sure to add your ticket number when registering. We have a maximum of 35 in-person spots, so those signing up too late will be put on a waiting list. If a spot opens up for you due to a cancellation or no-show, we can use your ticket number to find you on the conference floor.

**Important Information**

We have a dedicated CTF area on the upstairs balcony overlooking the main track of the conference. Unfortunately, it is not sound-proof or visually segregated from the rest of the conference. If you are sensitive to stimuli such as noise or light, we recommend you bring noise-cancelling headphones, earplugs, or any other appropriate gear you might need.

There is also a limited number of power plugs. Please come with a charged laptop and bring a powerbank if you have one.

If you have registered but find out you are no longer able to make it, please contact us so we can give your spot to someone on the waiting list.

Please speak to a BSides Amsterdam organizer or email us at [ctf@bsidesams.org](mailto:ctf@bsidesams.org) if you have any accessibility requirements or questions about the competition.
