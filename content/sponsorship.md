### What Is BSides?
BSides events combine security expertise from a variety of platforms in search of the “next big thing” in information security. BSides is an open platform that gives security experts and industry professionals the opportunity to share ideas, insights, and develop longstanding relationships with others in the community. It is a rare opportunity to directly connect and create trusted relationships with key members of the community.

BSides began in 2009 when talented speakers were unable to present at a major conference due to limited space and time. In response, BSides was created to expand opportunities, allowing more speakers, diverse topics, and innovative events to thrive beyond conventional conference limitations. The goal of BSides is to offer small intimate events where all participants can engage each other to help develop connections, friendships, and network with different industry professionals.

### Why Become A Sponsor?
We are looking to attract at least 200 information security professionals and industry leaders from across the Netherlands. We recognize the value in engaging a smaller audience and being the big fish in a small pond. Every organization will have different goals and priorities which is why we offer different levels of participation. We specifically designed several different options for any sized organization to participate and support this event.

- **Brand placement & awareness**  
    Based on your sponsorship level, your brand may be featured across
    various platforms, including the event website, t-shirts, promotional
    materials, signage, lanyards/badges, and even booths.

- **Stay in touch with the industry**  
    BSides provides a platform for supporters and participants to connect with industry leaders. Its attendees form a dynamic network within the security community, making them the ideal audience for meaningful    engagement.

- **Big fish, small pond**  
    For some, sponsoring large is not within their price range, limiting their ability to share their message. At BSides, we offer sponsorship opportunities for every budget, ensuring that your voice is heard, and your brand reaches a highly engaged community.

- **Be part of the next big thing**  
    BSides offers supporters and participants a unique opportunity to connect with industry leaders. Its attendees form a vibrant network within the security community, making them the key audience for meaningful engagement and collaboration.

### Sponsorship Packages
We offer two types of packages, regular packages on various levels. And special packages.
